        <p>What's more American than Nascar, Alabama Football, and spicy barbecue wings you ask? <br> Let me answer that in two words for you, Captain America. <br>With both sweet and nimble moves Captain America is a clear Marvel favorite. <br> A man who puts himself before others? A true man of service? A guy like this isn't even a once in a lifetime catch (because he isn't real). <br> In all seriousness I don't know much about any comics (I know nothing), but Captain America looks pretty cool.  </p>
